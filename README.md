## A Pixar Trivia Jr.

Created during Week 5 of Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. Only 15 seconds are alotted to each question. After all of the questions were finished, the final scoreboard of how well you did would appear. Implements Giphy API.

## Motivation

After creating my initial Pixar Trivia game (https://pixartrivia.herokuapp.com/), I had friends and family test it. The complaint was that the game was too difficult so I created a simpler version.
